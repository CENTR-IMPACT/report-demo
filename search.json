    "text": "Direct Indicators\nDirect Indicators are status counts of information including the number of partner institutions; the amount of time spent working together; the total number of attendees and participants at events and meetings; the total number of tools, documents, processes created to ensure fairness and accountability through the partnership; the total number of products—e.g., community-facing, scholar-facing—created; if engaged learning is a component of the project; and the number of agreed-to outcomes that have been met through the project.\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nCEnTR-IMPACT Direct Indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nOur Direct Indicators reflect the real-time contributions of our Rising Waters, Resilient Communities partnership. To date:\n\nPartners engaged: We have active collaborations with three coastal town councils (Mount Pleasant, Folly Beach, and Isle of Palms), two community organizations (SC Coastal Coalition and the Gullah Cultural Heritage Foundation), and the Coastal Resilience Network.\nHours invested: Together, more than 200 volunteer hours have been logged by community citizen scientists alongside university researchers measuring shoreline changes and sharing local knowledge.\nEvents and workshops: Over 150 residents attended our planning workshops, where participants mapped historic flood zones and contributed traditional ecological insights.\nCo-created resources: We’ve developed four community-facing tools—interactive flood maps, a mobile data log app, two workshop guides, and an oral-history recording protocol—and one scholarly article draft.\n\nThese counts capture our current scope: the breadth of our partnerships, the community’s invested time, and the co-designed outputs. While numbers alone don’t fully reflect the scope or depth of impact, they ground our shared journey and demonstrate the foundation we’re building together.\n\n\n\nNotes & Next Steps\n\n\n\n\nContinue updating attendance logs and volunteer hours, ensuring every citizen scientist’s contribution is recognized.\nRefine workshop evaluation by collecting brief participant feedback at the end of each session–this will inform improvements to our guides.\nTranslate the existing data log app interface into Spanish and Gullah phrases to increase accessibility for all community members.\nTrack the number of flood markers deployed and oral-history interviews completed, linking these counts into our next snapshot to illustrate growth over time."

Providing indicators across the domains of contexts, processes, research, and outcomes, Project Dynamics provides a map for facilitating a more successful and fair partnership.\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nCEnTR-IMPACT Project Dynamics scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nThe Project Dynamics scores (0.92 overall) underscore a balanced progression across five domains of Rising Waters, Resilient Communities. In particular:\n\nContexts (0.88): We’ve grounded our work in the lived experiences of coastal families, integrating Gullah heritage insights alongside local sea-level data. This place-based approach has helped foster trust between researchers and residents, a vital step in building lasting relationships and ensuring that the work reflects shared priorities.\nProcesses (0.94): Community advisory meetings and shared decision protocols have operated smoothly, reflecting strong co-governance.\nResearch & Interventions (0.46): As expected in Phase I, structured data collection tools are still under refinement, pointing to opportunities for deeper collaborative design of sampling methods.\nEngaged Learning (0.58): Student interns from PAU and RSU co-facilitated workshops, fostering bidirectional learning—however, we can expand mentorship roles for local high school students.\nOutcomes (0.44): While we’ve produced early deliverables (maps and protocols), we are still translating community goals into measurable resilience actions.\n\nThis distribution highlights our strong foundation in setting and collaboration, while signaling that research design and tangible community-driven outcomes warrant attention as we move deeper into co-created climate adaptation planning.\n\n\n\nNotes & Next Steps\n\n\n\n\nHost a research design co-lab where community members and university scientists draft next-phase survey questions and data-collection schedules together.\nDevelop a mentorship program pairing local youth with our graduate interns to expand engaged learning and share scientific skills.\nSet clear community-defined outcome targets, such as the number of flood mitigation recommendations adopted by town councils, and build metrics to track them.\nEmbed quarterly reflection sessions to revisit our decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and adjusting protocols based on community feedback."

Examining specific areas:\n\nHigh alignment on Values (0.69) shows we share a commitment to honoring traditional knowledge and scientific rigor.\nStrong researcher ratings on Resources (0.82) and Outputs (0.90) contrast with community ratings (0.49, 0.57), suggesting researchers feel well-equipped and prolific, while partners seek clearer communication around resource allocation and deliverable usefulness.\nCommunity-leading perceptions in Empowerment (0.77 vs. 0.68) and Outcomes (0.74 vs. 0.61) indicate that residents feel valued and hopeful about resilience gains, sometimes more so than researchers anticipate.\n\nThese differing views highlight our shared values but reveal operational gaps: partners want more involvement in deciding how resources are used and how outputs serve local needs.\n\n\n\nNotes & Next Steps\n\n\n\n\nConvene a resource transparency workshop, where budgets, equipment inventories, and data-access plans are laid out for discussion.\nCo-create an outputs review working group—including elders, youth, and researchers—to assess draft materials (maps, apps) for cultural relevance and usability.\nUse participatory methods (e.g., dot-voting) to renegotiate roles and responsibilities in upcoming phases, making adjustments based on partner priorities.\nSchedule bi-monthly check-ins to track alignment progress, using a simple shared dashboard accessible online and at community centers."
